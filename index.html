            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Sean. If you are here, you probably already know a lot about me. But just in case, I gonna talk alot about myself. 
            As of August 2021, I am currently going to Grade 8, so I am a minor, please don't do, you know :|
            I am currently trying to find what I love doing, so I have a lot of links for you, but currently
            I love coding (as you can tell), writing stories, watching Youtube, Debating, and doing random stuff that I won't need in life :D
            I also love watching movies and TV Shows, currently binging Breaking Bad. So yeah that is all I have to say about me, enjoy!</p>            
        	<h3>What this Website is About:</h3>
        	<p>This website is a hub for all the things I love. There will be links to stuff I made or own, I will be journaling different places I go or anything I want to say. I might add film reviews or things I post. There 				will also be other fun stuff I can add. Really it is all just my website, doing what I like to do. Maybe I can change this into something else, but for now, it is just a fun project!</p>
		
      		<h3>What I am including so far:</h3>
      		<ul>
      		<li> Link Nation
      		</ul>
     
        
        </div>
        <!-- all my social, discord, twitter, github, wattpad, youtube, etc -->
        <div id = "socials">
        
        <h2>Socials</h2>
        <p>Since I actually have friends, I am going to share with you some of the socials I have. This includes social media, other accounts, etc.</p>
        
        <h3>YouTube</h3>
        
        <img src = "./youtube.gif" />
        
        <p>Youtube is a great place for posting content no one will see. That being said, here is my channel:</p>

<p>It is mainly a cooking and garden channel, featuring me and my mom. There are lots of gardening tricks like different ways of fertilizing and making instecticides. It also includes different recipes like cooking kale, fish, etc. Please do subscribe, or just view some of those videos. </p>

<h3>Discord</h3>

<p>I have a discord account and a discord server as well! I talk there most of the time, and since I do not have facebook, twitter, instagram, etc, that is pretty much the only place you can contact me.</p>
