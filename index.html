            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Sean. If you are here, you probably already know a lot about me. But just in case, I gonna talk alot about myself. 
            As of August 2021, I am currently going to Grade 8, so I am a minor, please don't do, you know :|
            I am currently trying to find what I love doing, so I have a lot of links for you, but currently
            I love coding (as you can tell), writing stories, watching Youtube, Debating, and doing random stuff that I won't need in life :D
            I also love watching movies and TV Shows, currently binging Breaking Bad. So yeah that is all I have to say about me, enjoy!</p>            
        
        <h2>What this Website is About:</h2>
        <p>This website is a hub for all the things I love. There will be links to stuff I made or own, I will be journaling different places I go or anything I want to say. I might add film reviews or things I post. There will also be other fun stuff I can add. Really it is all just my website, doing what I like to do. Maybe I can change this into something else, but for now, it is just a fun project!</p>
